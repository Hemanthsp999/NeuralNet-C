This project implements a fully connected feedforward neural network from scratch in pure C. It includes the entire training lifecycle, custom memory management,
dataset parsing, and support for CLI-driven training, validation, and testing â€” all without external ML or linear algebra libraries.
The architecture closely resembles how modern deep learning frameworks operate internally, but is intentionally low-level and optimized for educational transparency,
systems control, and deployment in constrained environments.
